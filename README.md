# EntropyLane

### Secure Messaging Powered by Real-World Traffic Entropy

EntropyLane is a secure messaging system that derives cryptographic keys from
real-world traffic entropy instead of traditional pseudo-random sources.

The project demonstrates how traffic micro-variations such as arrival intervals,
jitter, and density can be transformed into high-quality entropy for
cryptographic applications.
